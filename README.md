# Webpack Code Splitting Demo

Webpack provides us a nice feature called [`code splitting`](https://webpack.github.io/docs/code-splitting.html),
and it's pretty easy to split our application using this. However, things may
be complicated when you have to split not only javascript code (i.e. CSS code).

Check a running demo [here](https://wmartins.github.io/webpack-code-splitting/dist).
